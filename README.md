This is a website I made in a class, and I grew upon it for fun. It utlizes Bootstrap capabilities to style and jQuery for database information management. 
Info may be entered into the contact page. That data is checked, and then uploaded to a php myAdmin database where it may be re-accessed. You may re-access 
entered data at this link: https://ec2-3-129-9-4.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/hw15/results.php This page dynamically updates and adds newly entered data 
to display. By using jQuery, this page updates every 500 ms to constantly show live info. Thanks for checking it out!
